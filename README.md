# GITHUB REPOSITORIES DISPLAY

### DESCRIPTION

Github Repositories Display is an application that displays my Github repositories. Users can view the full list of my repositories, search for specific repositories and view some details about each repository.

### INSTALLATION

To setup the project, I followed these steps:

1. Ensured I had Node.js installed on my computer.

2. I install the latest version of Vue 3 / Composition API using:
   `pnpm create vue@latest`

3. I install project dependencies and started the development server using:
   `pnpm install`
   `pnpm run dev`

### FEATURES

The application has the following features:

- Navigation Bar(NavBar): which provides a clear and consistent way to navigate through the application. It also contains a clear heading and logo which will help users identify the application.

- Search and Filter: users can quickly find the data they're interested in without having to scroll through potentially hundreds or thousands of items. Also, users can more efficiently interact with the data by narowing down the list of items.

- Pagination: which makes it easier for users to navigate through the data. They can easily move to the next page or go back to the previous page. It also provides a consistent layout and makes it easier to find specific items.

- Detailed View: provides users with comprehensive information about a specific repository without leaving the app. It also provides a link to the actual GitHub repository, allowing users to explore more about the repository on GitHub itself giving users the flexibility to delve deeper if they wish.

### DESIGN

The application was styled using vanilla CSS. Media Queries were defined for responsiveness to ensure the application is accessible across various devices and screen sizes. Dark mode styles were also included to users' comfort in different environments.
